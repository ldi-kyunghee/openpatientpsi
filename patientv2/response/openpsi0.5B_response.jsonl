{"id": 195, "response": "Hi. I guess... it's been a bit tough lately. The promotion thing just keeps bothering me. I feel like no matter what I do, I can’t really make it. It makes me scared to even start new projects. I keep thinking maybe everyone else is better than me. I’m usually quiet when it comes to talking about this stuff, which is why I’ve been avoiding most of the meetings. What do you think? Is there anything I can do differently? Maybe talk to someone about it? Thanks!"}
{"id": 196, "response": "Hi. I guess this week has been pretty tough at work. At the last team meeting, I suggested a new project idea, but no one really seemed interested. It felt like no one even gave a second thought to what I had to say. I’ve been thinking a lot about how everyone just shrugged me off without any explanation. It’s making me feel pretty ashamed and let down. I’m not sure if anyone noticed me speaking up or if maybe they’re just too busy thinking about stuff else. What should I do next? Should I keep talking or try something different? Any advice or tips would be appreciated. Thanks!"}
{"id": 197, "response": "Hi. I’m just feeling kind of... lost right now. At work, I tried to bring up my idea earlier, but it didn’t get much attention. Afterward, I just felt like no one really took it seriously. It made me feel like maybe I’m not worth considering or making any big changes. I’ve been avoiding talking about it anymore because I worry people might think I’m useless or stupid. Is this normal? Or did something happen recently that caused this? I don’t know what to expect from therapy. Just curious how things are going. Thanks for your help!"}
{"id": 198, "response": "I guess it’s hard to explain exactly how things have been since that promotion. I keep feeling like everyone else is just better at their job. It makes me feel so inadequate and invisible. I don’t know why, but when I’m around people who seem to excel in certain tasks, it just feels like I’m not cut out for this job anymore. I’ve been trying to work extra long hours lately, but nothing seems to make a difference. Sometimes I wonder if I really am capable or if I’m just stuck here because I’m not looking the right way. Honestly, I don’t want to talk about it much with anyone. It’s been frustrating, but maybe it’s just how things are. What can I do? I just hope it gets better soon."}
{"id": 199, "response": "Hi. I guess my experience last week was pretty rough. At the seminar, I just felt kind of lost when I couldn’t keep up with the coding stuff they were doing. It’s like no matter what I try, it’s always easier for people around me. I kept thinking maybe I’m not cut out for this job or that I’ll mess things up. After the seminar, I just ended up staying home instead of talking to anyone again. It’s hard to say if I really fixed myself or if it was just some temporary glitch. I’ve been thinking about it lately, and it makes me feel like I’m failing at everything. It’s exhausting. What do you think? Is there anything I could be doing differently to help improve?"}
{"id": 200, "response": "Hi. I guess… things have been kind of rough lately at work. Last week, my boss gave me feedback on my presentation, and I just kept thinking, “This is so wrong! Why can’t I fix this?” I ended up spending hours redoing everything again, even after being told to stop. It felt like no matter how much I tried, it wasn’t working. I’m not sure if I’ve really made any progress. I keep putting myself down, wondering if everyone else thinks I’m dumb too. Honestly, it’s making me feel pretty anxious and ashamed. What should I do? Should I just give up? Help me figure this out, please. Thanks."}
