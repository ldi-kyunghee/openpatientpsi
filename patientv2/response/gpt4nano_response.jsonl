{"id": 2, "response": "Um, hi. I guess… this week was okay, but there was this one dinner with my family that felt kind of rough. I tried to tell Mark about my promotion, but he kept interrupting and talking about his work instead. I didn’t really say much after that because it just felt like what I had to say didn’t matter. I don’t know, maybe I’m just being too sensitive."}
{"id": 3, "response": "Um, hi. I guess... this week was kind of tough. At the workshop, I felt like everyone else was just so much quicker to get things, and I was stuck trying to keep up. It was embarrassing, really. I don’t know, maybe I’m just not cut out for this kind of work."}
{"id": 4, "response": "I guess it’s been really hard since that meeting. I keep replaying what my boss said, and it just feels like I can’t do anything right.

Sometimes I just want to avoid the meetings altogether because I’m scared of more criticism. It’s like no matter what I do, I’m not good enough."}
{"id": 5, "response": "I guess... last week was really hard. My daughter said I was too controlling in front of everyone, and it just crushed me.

Then I tried to be nicer, like, too nice, almost like I was scared they'd hate me if I wasn’t."}
{"id": 6, "response": "Yeah, I guess... I just can’t stop thinking about that mistake I made. It feels like I’m a complete failure, you know?

It’s hard to shake off the feeling that I’m just not good enough."}
{"id": 7, "response": "Hi, I guess… it’s been a rough week. That family reunion was harder than I thought. When my sister said that about her kids being better behaved, I just felt… awful. Like I’m failing completely as a mother. I ended up just staying quiet the rest of the time."}
{"id": 8, "response": "Hi. I guess… the meeting didn’t go very well. I had some ideas I thought were good, but they just brushed them off. It made me feel like I’m not really taken seriously here. I don’t know, maybe I’m just not cut out for this."}
{"id": 9, "response": "Hi. I guess… it’s been a tough week. The rent increase notice really hit me hard.

{"id": 12, "response": "Hi, I’m not really sure where to start. The family dinner last week was... tough. When my mom criticized my choice to keep working, I just felt so small and like I was failing everyone. I ended up just shutting down and not saying much after that. I don’t know, it’s like I’m always trying to prove I’m doing enough, but maybe I never really am."}

{"id": 15, "response": "Hi. I guess it’s been a rough week. I don’t really see the point in talking about it much. I was passed over for that promotion again, and it just feels like I’m not good enough. Everyone else seems to get ahead except me."}

{"id": 19, "response": "Hi. I guess the workshop was... okay. I mean, I struggled a bit with some of the new stuff, but maybe that's normal? Everyone else seemed to get it faster, though. I’m not sure if I’m just slower or if I’m missing something."}
{"id": 20, "response": "Um, I guess... at the dinner party, I just felt kind of invisible? Like, Tom was really into talking with everyone else, and I was just there. It made me think maybe I wasn’t interesting enough for him or for the others. I tried to smile and join in, but it felt like I was just faking it. I don’t know, maybe I’m just overthinking it."}

It’s like no matter what I do, I’m just the “underachiever” in their eyes."}

{"id": 24, "response": "Yeah, I guess I’ve been pretty stressed out at work lately. My supervisor told me my last report wasn’t up to standard, and now I can’t stop thinking that maybe I’m just not cut out for this job. Even though I’ve had good reviews before, this one comment feels like it’s all anyone sees. I’ve been staying late, trying to fix everything, but it just makes me more anxious. Honestly, I’m worried I’m going to mess up so badly that I’ll end up alone, like always."}
{"id": 25, "response": "I guess... at the dinner party, when I saw Tom laughing with his coworker, I just felt this knot in my stomach. It was like, immediately, I thought he must find her more interesting than me. I kept trying to get his attention, asking him if he still found me attractive, but it felt like I was just embarrassing myself. I know it sounds silly, but I couldn’t help feeling jealous and kind of worthless. Maybe I’m just too sensitive."}
{"id": 26, "response": "Hi. Yeah, the team event was... okay, I guess. I tried to join in with some people, but they just kind of smiled briefly and then went back to their own conversation. It made me feel like I wasn’t really welcome or wanted there. I don't know, maybe I was just imagining it."}
{"id": 27, "response": "Yeah, I guess... It just felt like John wasn’t really paying attention to me at all. I don’t know, maybe I’m just overthinking it. It’s hard to explain, but I just felt kind of invisible at the dinner."}

{"id": 29, "response": "Um, I guess the dinner was... okay, but I don’t really want to talk about it much. It’s just the same old stuff, you know? My sister’s comments really got to me, but I’m not sure what difference it makes to say anything about it. I just ended up feeling kind of... useless."}
{"id": 30, "response": "Um, I guess… it’s been kind of hard this past week. I noticed my partner hasn’t been as open about where they’ve been, and it’s been making me feel… I don’t know, uneasy. I keep wondering if they’re choosing to spend time with someone else because I’m just not interesting enough. I find myself checking their phone sometimes, even though I don’t want to. It just feels like I’m waiting for them to prove me wrong, but they never do."}
{"id": 31, "response": "Um, yeah, so last week there was this work social event... I tried to join a group of colleagues who were talking about a project.

I guess it just made me feel... left out and kind of sad."}
{"id": 32, "response": "Yeah, I guess... I just feel like no matter how much I try, it’s never enough. That email from the client this morning really hit me hard. It’s like they see through me, like I’m not just bad at my job but something worse. I don’t know, maybe I just mess everything up, and it’s only a matter of time before everyone realizes it. I’ve been keeping to myself a lot at work lately because I don’t want to cause any more problems."}
{"id": 33, "response": "Um, I guess… it was kind of hard to hear that from my boss. I mean, I usually do my best to keep everything on track.

{"id": 38, "response": "Yeah, I guess... that comment at dinner really stuck with me. It just made me feel like I’m failing my kids somehow, like I’m not measuring up to what a “good” parent should be. I keep thinking maybe everyone else sees me the same way now. It’s hard not to take it personally, you know? Sometimes I just want to avoid those family gatherings altogether."}
{"id": 39, "response": "Uh, I guess the workshop didn’t go very well for me. I kept falling behind, and it felt like everyone else was picking it up so much faster. I’m not sure why I even tried to keep up; it just made me feel... worse. I ended up sitting quietly, not really talking much. It’s like I was just waiting for the whole thing to be over."}
{"id": 40, "response": "Yeah, I guess… it’s been tough this past week. I haven’t really looked at my investment accounts because, honestly, I’m scared of what I’ll find.

{"id": 44, "response": "Hi. I guess... I’m feeling pretty down about what happened at the family dinner last week. I tried to share my promotion, but no one really seemed to care.

{"id": 45, "response": "Hi. I guess the week hasn't been great. At work, we found out there won’t be any bonuses this year because the company is struggling financially.

It’s hard to even talk about it."}
{"id": 50, "response": "Um, yeah, I guess… at lunch the other day, I tried to say something about that new TV show everyone’s been watching.

I don’t know… maybe I just shouldn’t try to join in next time."}
{"id": 51, "response": "I guess it was frustrating. I tried to say something, but it felt like nobody was really listening. I just ended up quiet for the rest of the meeting. It’s like what I say doesn’t really matter to them. Maybe my ideas just aren’t worth sharing."}
{"id": 52, "response": "Hi. I guess... I just don’t know if it’s worth talking about things sometimes. Like, when I brought up the idea of going to Europe for vacation, he just brushed it off like it was some silly fantasy. It made me feel kind of invisible, like my thoughts don’t really matter. I don’t even know if I should bother sharing what I want anymore."}

{"id": 90, "response": "Well, honestly, I’ve been feeling pretty awful since that meeting. I keep thinking that everyone must have thought I was completely clueless when I was presenting.

{"id": 91, "response": "Yeah, I guess… it’s been really hard since I found out about the bonus cut. I keep thinking maybe my boss sees me as less capable now.

Sometimes I wonder if I should just look for something easier before I mess up again."}
{"id": 95, "response": "Yeah, I guess it was a pretty big screw-up. I just keep thinking that if I can't even handle something as basic as my budget, what else am I going to mess up? It’s like no matter how careful I try to be, I’m always going to fail at this stuff. Sometimes I just want to avoid looking at my accounts altogether because it just stresses me out more. I don’t know, maybe I’m just not cut out for managing money."}

I guess the family dinner was... okay, but there was this moment when my sister called me \"the underachiever.\" It kind of stuck with me, but I didn’t really want to make a big deal out of it.

{"id": 101, "response": "Yeah, I guess last week was pretty rough. I missed that deadline because my team didn’t get their parts done on time, and I just kept thinking, maybe they think I’m useless now.

{"id": 103, "response": "Yeah, I guess... It just feels like no matter how hard I try, it’s never enough. When my proposal got rejected, I couldn’t help but think that maybe they’re right—that I’m just not cut out for this job.

{"id": 104, "response": "Hi. I guess… last week’s meeting was kind of rough for me. I had an idea I thought was okay, but when I shared it, no one really seemed to care. It just made me feel like maybe I shouldn’t speak up at all. I don’t know, maybe my ideas just aren’t good enough."}

Sometimes I wonder if I’m just not cut out for this kind of stability."}

I don’t know, it’s stupid, but I kept wondering if everyone thought I was boring. I just ended up sitting there quietly because I didn’t want to make things worse."}
{"id": 175, "response": "Uh, yeah, I guess the meeting was... okay. I tried to say something, but then, well, someone else just jumped in and said almost the same thing. It felt like no one really cared about what I had to say. I didn’t want to make a scene, so I just kept quiet after that. I don’t know, it’s probably nothing."}
{"id": 176, "response": "Um, yeah... the retreat was... kind of hard for me. I tried to join this group of new people, but they just smiled politely and kept talking without really including me. I felt like maybe I was just bothering them or that they didn’t want me there. So, I just kind of stayed quiet and looked at my phone the rest of the time. It was... disappointing, I guess."}
{"id": 177, "response": "Hi. I guess... last week was kind of rough. In a meeting, I suggested an idea, and it just got shot down pretty quickly. It made me feel like maybe I don’t really know what I’m doing. I didn’t really say much after that."}
{"id": 178, "response": "I guess the week was... okay, I suppose. I mean, work was stressful, like usual. I keep thinking about that meeting where they said the project is behind. It just... it messes with my head, you know? Makes me feel like I'm not doing enough."}
{"id": 179, "response": "Yeah, I guess I just feel like no matter how much I prepare, it’s never good enough. When my boss said my presentation was off, it really hit me hard. I keep thinking maybe I’m just not cut out for this job. It’s frustrating because I spent weeks on it, but now I just want to redo everything over and over. Honestly, I’ve been avoiding my coworkers because I don’t want them to see me like this."}
{"id": 180, "response": "I guess the meeting didn’t go well. I just... I don’t know, it felt like no one really wanted to hear what I had to say. It’s like my ideas don’t matter. I’m not sure if I should even try next time."}
{"id": 181, "response": "Hi, I guess I’m not sure where to start... This week was really tough. My supervisor criticized my presentation, and I just can’t stop thinking about how badly I messed up. It feels like no matter what I do, I’m just going to keep failing. I keep worrying that I’m just not cut out for this job."}
{"id": 182, "response": "Hi. I guess… this past week was tough. I found out I didn’t get the promotion I was hoping for, and it just kind of… hit me hard. I keep thinking maybe I didn’t do enough, or maybe I’m just not good enough. I’ve been trying to work more, but it feels like no matter what I do, it’s never enough."}
{"id": 183, "response": "Yeah, the family gathering... it was kind of rough. Maria tried to talk about her promotion, but no one really seemed to care. I just felt invisible again, like no matter what, I’m always the last person anyone pays attention to. It’s like I don’t matter at all. Honestly, I just pulled back and pretended everything was fine, even though I felt awful inside."}
{"id": 184, "response": "Hi. Um, I guess the dinner was okay, but... I felt kind of ignored. I tried to say something about my promotion, but my husband kept talking about his work instead. It was frustrating, but I didn’t really want to make a fuss, so I just stayed quiet. I don’t know, maybe it wasn’t a big deal."}
{"id": 185, "response": "Hi. I guess… last week was pretty rough. I was in that meeting, and when my manager called me out for missing the deadline, I just felt like everyone was looking at me like I’m some kind of failure. It’s like no matter what I do, I can’t seem to get it right. I’ve been trying to avoid speaking up in meetings since then because I’m scared I’ll mess up again."}
{"id": 186, "response": "Hi. Yeah, I got that notice about the rent increase last week. Honestly, I haven’t really done anything about it yet. It just feels... overwhelming, like maybe I’m not cut out to handle this kind of stuff on my own. I guess I’m just scared about what it means for me and my kids."}
{"id": 187, "response": "I guess the party was... okay. I tried to talk to some people, but it felt like they didn’t really want me there. They kind of just drifted away after a while. It was embarrassing, I suppose. I don’t know, maybe I just don’t fit in."}
{"id": 188, "response": "Um, I guess the meeting didn't go very well. I felt like as soon as I started talking, people were already judging me, like they thought I wasn't ready or capable. It was hard to keep up with all the criticism, and honestly, I just wanted to disappear. I kept thinking maybe this is what I deserve, that I’m not cut out for this role. I’ve been working late trying to fix everything, but it just feels never-ending."}
{"id": 189, "response": "I guess... it was just really hard to hear them joking like that. It felt like they were confirming what I already think about myself—that I'm just a failure. I ended up just sitting by myself because I didn’t want to hear any more. Honestly, it made me want to avoid everyone, like I don't belong there. I don’t know, maybe I’m just too sensitive."}
{"id": 190, "response": "Hi, I guess I’m feeling pretty down about work lately. I didn’t get the promotion I was hoping for, and honestly, it just feels like no matter what I do, it’s never enough. I’ve been staying late to try and prove myself, but it’s exhausting, and I still feel invisible. Sometimes I wonder if I’m just not good enough, even though I try so hard."}
{"id": 191, "response": "Um, hi. I guess this week was kind of tough. My boss gave me three new projects all at once, and it just felt like way too much. I tried to keep up, but I was worried I’d mess something up. I don’t know, it’s just hard to feel confident when there’s so much on my plate."}
{"id": 192, "response": "I guess... this week was pretty rough. I got a bill for my car that I wasn’t expecting—$500. It just hit me hard because I always try so hard to keep my finances in order, and this felt like proof that I’m just not good enough at it. I kept thinking, maybe I’m just irresponsible, or that I’m failing at managing my life. It’s been hard to even look at my bank account since then."}
{"id": 193, "response": "I guess... it’s just hard to talk about. I mean, it’s not like I wanted to make a big deal out of it, but when he said he didn’t want to go, I just felt... I don’t know, like I wasn’t important enough. It’s stupid, really. Maybe I’m just overthinking it."}
{"id": 194, "response": "Hi. I guess… it’s been a tough week. I was really hoping to get that promotion, but when they gave it to someone else, I just felt… invisible, I guess. It’s like no matter what I do, it’s never enough. And then, when my idea got dismissed in the meeting, I just wanted to disappear."}
{"id": 195, "response": "Yeah, I guess... I just feel like I messed up again. It’s hard to explain, but it’s like no matter how much I try, I’m always falling short. I don’t really want to talk about it much. It’s just… frustrating."}
{"id": 196, "response": "Hi. I guess... the family gathering was kind of hard for me. I tried to tell them about my promotion, but it felt like no one really cared. They just started talking about my brother again. It made me feel like I’m just invisible or something. I don’t know, maybe I’m just overthinking it."}
{"id": 197, "response": "Um, hi. I guess... I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed after that workshop last week. Everyone else seemed to pick up the new programming stuff pretty quickly, but I just kept struggling, and it made me feel kind of... stupid, I guess. I didn’t really want to speak up or ask questions because I was worried they’d think I’m not cut out for this. It’s just frustrating, and I’m not sure what to do about it."}
{"id": 198, "response": "I guess... I just keep thinking maybe I’m not really cut out for this job. Like, why else would they pick someone less experienced over me? It feels like all the effort I put in just doesn’t matter. I’m just tired of feeling like I’m always falling short."}
{"id": 199, "response": "Um, hi. I guess... the seminar was kind of tough for me. I noticed pretty quickly that I was the only one there without an advanced certification, and that made me feel, well, kind of out of place. I didn’t really say much or participate because I just felt like everyone else was on a different level. It was embarrassing, honestly."}
{"id": 200, "response": "I guess it was just frustrating. I mean, I said something, but no one really seemed to care. It’s like I’m invisible in those meetings. I don’t know, maybe I just don’t have anything worth hearing. It’s easier to just keep quiet after that."}
